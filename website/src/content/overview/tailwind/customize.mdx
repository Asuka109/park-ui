## Concept

The Tailwind Plugin uses the generated static CSS classes from the Park UI Panda recipes as a preset. In this guide, we
will explore various ways to tailor Park UI to your specific needs and make it truly yours.

### Tailwind theme config

The Park UI Tailwind theme config is a powerful and comprehensive way to customize the appearance of Park UI components.
It allows you to adjust various design elements such as the color palette, accent colors, and border radius, effectively
transforming the look and feel of your UI components.

Here's how you can set your theme preferences in your Tailwind config file:

```js
const { parkwindPlugin } = require('@park-ui/tailwind-plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [parkwindPlugin],
  parkUI: {
    accentColor: 'neutral',
    grayColor: 'neutral',
    borderRadius: 'md',
  },
  darkMode: ['class'],
  // ...
}
```

This configuration lets you control elements like color palettes and accent hues to align your UI with your brand
identity and project style. You can find the supported values under "Make it yours" on the documentation page.

### Adding classes to recipes

Park UI components are composed of various classes that define their appearance. You can further customize component
variants by adding or modifying classes. For example, if you want to underline the solid button variant, you can include
the underline class within its definition:

```js
import { tv } from 'tailwind-variants'

export const buttonStyles = tv({
  base: 'button',
  // ...
  variants: {
    variant: {
      solid: 'button--variant_solid underline',
      // ...
    },
    // ...
  },
})
```

This approach empowers you to make granular changes to individual component styles, allowing you to create a UI that
suits your specific needs.

### Extending CSS Classes

Sometimes, you may need to go beyond what the preset classes offer. To make more advanced customizations, you can extend
the CSS classes of the Park UI components. This lets you create entirely new styles or modify existing ones:

```css
.button--variant_solid {
  @apply underline;
}
```

This approach enables you to craft unique and specific design changes while keeping your customizations organized and
maintainable.
